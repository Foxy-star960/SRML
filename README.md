# Slime Rancher Mod Loader #
A completely open source mod loader and moddding framework for the game Slime Rancher

## Building ##
SRML depends on a __publicized Assembly-CSharp.dll__ which can be obtained using CabbageCrow's [Assembly Publicizer](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer)

Once obtained, and a publicized assembly generated, follow the **wiki** for a setup guide.
